                <div class="col">
                    <p>Native advertising is a kind of advertising that takes the form of the advertising platform. In other words, it doesn’t feel or behave like a normal advertisement. Instead, it feels like a part of the platform on which it is displayed. As long as the sponsored piece of content is “in-feed,” and doesn’t disrupt the normal user experience of the platform, it can be referred to as “native” advertising.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <p>According to Dictionary.com, Native Advertising is “content on a website that conforms to the design and format of the site and is integrated into the site’s usual content.”</p>
                    <p>The most common type of native advertising is editorial-based content, in similar subject and style to the rest of the content already on the platform. However, the label of native advertising can also be applied to other areas, like sponsored social media posts.</p>

                    <p>Traditional display advertising has been around for centuries, and easily made the transition to the digital world of the internet. Websites, platforms, and search engines have long sold traditional display advertising space on their pages as a way to generate revenue. And, advertisers realized a nice return on their investment.</p>
                    <p>However, over time, the phenomenon of “ad blindness” has taken over, which causes typical users to have to see an ad several times before they even notice it. Even in cases where users do notice the ads, the quality of engagement compared to the number of clicks has taken a steep drop.</p>
                    <p>Clicks are still there, but the same can’t be said of engagement.</p>
                    <p>As more advertisers flooded the display advertisement space, the more ad blindness became apparent. As ads became more common, they also became less effective.</p>
                    <p>The diverging graphs of decreased effectiveness and increased cost has led advertisers to try something else: value-first advertising.</p>

                    <p>Value-first is an assumption that, if you give the reader something of value, they are more likely to respond positively toward your offer, or advertisement. This assumption has largely been proven valid, which has led larger publishers and advertisers to approach advertising through a new vehicle: sponsored content.</p>

                    <p>While sponsored content can take a lot of different forms, the purpose is to provide value through the content, which is used to drive engagement with the targeted offer. ‘Value,’ in the sponsored content approach, can be defined as anything that is educational, inspirational, or even entertaining.</p>

                        <p>Entrepreneur magazine <a href="#">pointed out</a> that the&nbsp;majority of&nbsp;users trust sponsored content more than traditional advertising. And&nbsp;the&nbsp;difference is&nbsp;getting wider as&nbsp;the&nbsp;public increasingly tires of&nbsp;traditional advertising methods.</p>
                        <p>Apple,&nbsp;for instance, released ad&nbsp;blockers in&nbsp;Safari web browser by&nbsp;default. Ad&nbsp;blocker apps are&nbsp;very popular, even among younger demographics. And&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;modern streaming technology, commercials are&nbsp;being skipped.</p>

                            <p>When the Camaro Zl1  1LE was tested at the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife track, GM recognized the opportunity to engage their audience and increase buzz. Rather than creating advertisements for the vehicle, they decided to document the event.</p>
                            <p><i>“We sent a film crew to capture it all (in-car, aerial, interviews, driver prep, etc.),” said Whitney Drake. “Then we researched the hottest racing video games for inspiration and designed an interface to overlay the video, making it feel much more modern and interactive.”</i></p>

                            <p><i>“We knew the Camaro’s time would garner coverage, but through integrated storytelling and powerful assets, we transformed what could have been standard coverage into a powerful moment in car history for enthusiasts across the globe.”</i> Drake said.</p>

                            <p>Airbnb disrupted an industry that had been free of new ideas for decades. And, they are doing the same with their content marketing strategies.</p>
                            <p>Alex Beauchamp, Head of Global Content and Social Media for Airbnb explains their content strategy as a way to create a world of fewer strangers and more friends. This is key to understanding their content marketing - their brand is not just about cheap rooms on vacation - content about that would be boring.</p>

One was a customer of Airbnb and the other the host - meeting helped both men heal scars they had carried for many years.</p>

                    <p>The elusive secret of effective native content lies in user engagement. You can create content for years, but it won’t matter if it’s not content your audience wants to engage with.</p>
                    <blockquote>Creating content is&nbsp;hard. Engaging your target audience is&nbsp;even&nbsp;harder.</blockquote>
                    <p>Effective native advertising is the marriage of two separate principles: interesting content and a deep understanding of the ideal audience for that content.</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <p>Felix Baumgartner dropping from space is interesting content, but doesn’t appeal to Allstate Insurance’s audience in a meaningful way. However, for the young adrenaline junkies of the world, those who consume the most Red Bull, the prospect of jumping from the edge of space is invigorating and inspiring. They not only want to be associated with the brand that did it, but they also want to do it themselves.</p>
                    <p>The sad truth is, for every GoPro and Airbnb, there are hundreds of companies struggling to get results from their native content advertising campaigns. However, with the right tools, you can get the insight to close the gap between interesting content and audience engagement.</p>
